# Hi, I am LancerComet.

I’m currently working at a startup, where I’m responsible for core development. Because of this, life has become extremely busy — both during and outside of work hours.

I created a manga reader called Rulia, which is publicly available for download and free to use. You can get it [here](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9mvvlrzwrxx8). I have no intention of abandoning the project, though it hasn’t received updates recently.

Please note that I may not be able to respond to issues or feedback in a timely manner. Startup life demands a significant amount of my time and energy. Thank you very much for your understanding.

If you’re interested in what I’m working on now, you can check it out [here](https://factory.miguocomics.com/). It is a creative tool for professional artists, powered by our own self-trained models. It’s a step-by-step creative assistant tool designed to help professional artists with the time-consuming parts of the workflow, such as line-art refinement and flat-color filling. It is not a "press one button and replace human artists" system like Stable Diffusion. It focuses on supporting artists, not replacing them.
